			Design and support secure, resilient systems and internal tools that are simple to operate,

			<h3 class="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
				Near-Term (0-12 months)
			</h3>
			<ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
				<li>
					Reach an intermediate level with Java and Spring Boot this rotation by building at least
					one feature end-to-end in our codebase, writing tests, and getting a clean PR review.
				</li>
				<li>
					Get hands-on with our CI/CD pipeline: make one change that improves a build, test, or
					deploy step and document how the pipeline works for the team.
				</li>
				<li>
					Level up how I write maintainable, reliable code—follow team patterns, add helpful unit
					and integration tests, and leave clear docs so future edits are straightforward.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<!-- Mid-Term Goals -->
		<div
			class="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm dark:border-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-700"
		>
			<h3 class="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Mid-Term (1-3 years)</h3>
			<ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
				<li>
					In the next 1-2 months, get smoother with collaborative Git workflows (branching, reviews,
					rebases) and contribute consistently to team PRs.
				</li>
				<li>
					Over the next 6-12 months, lock in a role I enjoy and focus on deepening the skills that
					fit the work—technical and soft skills.
				</li>
				<li>
					Earn a relevant certification (Linux, networking, cloud, or virtualization) that supports
					infrastructure engineering goals.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<!-- Long-Term Goals -->

			<ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
				<li>
					In 3-5 years, be in a stable role I enjoy; where I am challenged, learning, and
					contributing to reliable, secure systems.
				</li>
				<li>
					Build and maintain well-automated, observable services with solid incident response and
					post-incident learning.
				</li>
				<li>
					Develop a strong professional network and mentor where I can help teams deliver with
					clarity and confidence.

			How This Aligns with My Experience
		</h2>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
			<li>
				Rotations span Managed File Transfer (IBM Sterling), x86 Server Management (VMware/Nutanix),
				and Interoperability Systems (Spring Boot / MSSQL / FHIR); a solid mix of operations and
				software.
			</li>
			<li>
				Projects include an application portal built with SvelteKit, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and S3; a
				good example of planning, teamwork, and shipping a completed product.
			</li>
			<li>
				Across everything: clear documentation, repeatable workflows, and steady delivery are what
				I'm aiming for.
